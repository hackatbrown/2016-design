# Hack@Brown Design 2016

Hi! You've found our massive repository of design assets for Hack@Brown 2016 (and other Hack@Brown-related events this school year.) This includes most of the graphic materials you might have seen at the event and around campus, plus concept designs that never saw the light of day. We've tried to include source files (sketch, ai, etc) when possible, rather than rendered images.
